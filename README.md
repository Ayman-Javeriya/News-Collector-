# News-Collector-
In this modern world we know that there are a lot of news websites and they cover news on 
various topics, out of which very few are of our interest. A new aggregator can be a tool to save 
a lot of time and with some modifications and filtrations we can fine tune it to show only news 
of our interest. A news aggregator is a very useful application to view information within 
minimum time. We can build a news aggregator application by scrapping some famous 
websites and serving the scrapped articles via Django on web or in any app. It is a web 
application which aggregates data from multiple websites. Then shows the articles on desired 
pages.
In a news aggregator, you can read news from various websites. Then the news aggregator 
collects the article for you. And just after a click or two, you can view news of your choice.
